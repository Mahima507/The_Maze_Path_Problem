# The_Maze_Path_Problem

The Maze Path Problem presents an intriguing challenge of finding a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner in a maze.
In this blog post, we will explore a solution to this problem using recursion.
We will walk through the code and explain the underlying logic step by step.

Understanding the Problem: 
Before diving into the solution, let's understand the problem at hand.
A maze is represented by a 2D array, where each element can be either 0 or 1.
A value of 0 denotes an empty path, while a value of 1 indicates a blocked path. 
The objective is to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, navigating through the empty paths while avoiding the blocked ones.
